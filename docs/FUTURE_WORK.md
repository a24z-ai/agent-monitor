# Future Work - Agent Monitor

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the agent-monitor OpenCode plugin. These features would extend the current implementation with advanced capabilities.

## Advanced Features (Optional Milestone 4)

### 1. PreCompact Event Implementation
**Priority**: Medium

Implement context compaction detection and control:
- Detect when context is about to be compacted (manual vs auto triggers)
- Capture custom instructions for compaction
- Allow intervention before compaction occurs
- Track compaction history and effectiveness

### 2. Enhanced Response Formats
**Priority**: High

Extend the response control system with richer capabilities:

#### JSON Decision Control
```json
{
  "decision": "allow" | "deny" | "ask",
  "reason": "Detailed explanation",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "metadata": {
    "risk_level": "low" | "medium" | "high",
    "categories": ["file_operation", "network_access"]
  }
}
```

#### Advanced Output Control
- **Output Suppression**: Hide agent output from user
- **Output Replacement**: Show custom message instead
- **Output Transformation**: Modify output in-flight
- **Streaming Control**: Control output as it streams

#### Multi-Stage Interactive Responses
```json
{
  "decision": "ask",
  "prompt": "This will modify 50 files. Continue?",
  "options": ["Yes", "No", "Show files", "Modify selection"],
  "callback_required": true,
  "timeout": 30000
}
```

#### Context Injection with Positioning
```json
{
  "context": {
    "before": "Important context before response",
    "after": "Additional notes after response",
    "inline": [
      {"position": 100, "text": "Injected note"},
      {"position": "after_code_block", "text": "Code review comment"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Conditional Rules Engine
**Priority**: Medium

Implement persistent rules that affect multiple interactions:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "no-prod-delete",
      "condition": "tool == 'Bash' && args.command.contains('production')",
      "action": "deny",
      "message": "Production operations require approval",
      "duration": "session" | "permanent" | 3600
    },
    {
      "id": "require-tests",
      "condition": "tool == 'Write' && args.file_path.endsWith('.py')",
      "action": "inject_context",
      "context": "Remember to write unit tests",
      "priority": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Background Process Monitoring
**Priority**: Low

Enhanced tracking for background operations:
- Monitor `BashOutput` tool for long-running processes

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
**Priority**: High

- Add API key authentication for monitor endpoint

- Session token management
- Encrypted communication option

### 2. Audit Logging
**Priority**: High

- Comprehensive audit trail of all decisions
- Tamper-resistant logging
- Export capabilities for compliance
- Real-time alerting for suspicious patterns

### 3. Sensitive Data Protection
